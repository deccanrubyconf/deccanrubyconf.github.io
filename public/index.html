    <h1>Deccan RubyConf Turns 2 This Year</h1>

    <p>Last time we made it happen <span>('hao{ do!')</span> and had a little fun. This
      time, we're taking it up a notch to have <strong>Full2Dhamaal.</strong></p>

    <p>Besides talks that are as much fun for beginners as they are for
      experts, this year’s conference also promises a 5k Run, a Futsal tournament & a
      <strong>Dhamaal</strong> party at a local brewpub.</p>

    <p>Plus we continue our unique tradition of allowing corporate sponsorships for
      students. So students, <a

    <div class="dhamaal-wrap">
      <p>What is Full2Dhamaal?</p>

      <P>Full2 = Puneri slang for Full, Total, Absolute & Dhamaal = Marathi word for

                    Apparently, he also attempts to ride a surf board in hot tubs and
                    enjoys listening to and playing insufferable loud music in his secret
                    laboratory 250 ft below the earth of the Outback. Should he ever leave
                    his bunker, make sure to hug him if you meet him in person.</p>

              <p>Nick usually hangs around in pools sipping icey cold caipirinhas with his
                fellow open-source comrades and calls this a "conference". Apparently, he
                also attempts to ride a surf board in hot tubs and enjoys listening to and
                playing insufferable loud music in his secret laboratory 250 ft below the
                earth of the Outback. Should he ever leave his bunker, make sure to hug
                him if you meet him in person.</p>
