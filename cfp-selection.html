          CFP Selection Process
        </h1>
        <br/><br/>
        <h3 class="get-sponsors">Intro</h3>
        <p>We recently updated and announced our <a href="index.html#schedule">program </a> this year. We are stoked to have an amazing
          lineup with a mixture of tech and not-tech talks.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>If you haven't already, go checkout our <a href="index.html#speakers"> Speakers</a>. This year, we have speakers from Australia, Canada, Europe, United States,
          and of-course India 🇮🇳 </p>
        <p>I hope you have <a href="https://www.townscript.com/e/drc16">booked</a> yourself a ticket already ;-) </p>

        <br/><br />
        <h3 class="get-sponsors">CFP Announcement and Reception</h3>

        <p>We start the CFP immediately after RubyConfIndia concludes. This year, we announced our CFP around the end of March.
          We made use of papercall this year, to not have to setup our own CFP App, as well as the ease papercall gives Presenters to submit to multiple conferences, with better submission tools.</p>
        <p>You can find the CFP <a href="https://www.papercall.io/deccanrubyconf-2016">here.</a></p>
        <br/>
        <p>On its closure on 31st May, which was about 2 months of time for Presentors to submit, we had about 41 submissions.</a></p>

        <br/><br />
        <h3 class="get-sponsors"> Selection Process</h3>

        <p>The selection process comprised of-</p>
        <ul class="coc">
          <li>Blind Review of Proposals</li>
          <li>Asking Authors to provide more suitable feedback as suitable for a proposal, to understand the expectations from the talk.</li>
          <li>Initial selection of proposals based on the blind review</li>
          <li>Marking and selecting talks to present</li>
          <li>Announcing initial talks</li>
          <li>Discussion about talks to mark as wait list and final completion of remaining talks, based on already selected talks and domains.</li>
          <li>Marking and selecting talks to wait list</li>
          <li>Getting confirmation to talks both on selected and wait list and announcing the program</li>
        </ul>

        <br/><br />
        <h3 class="get-sponsors">The Selection Team</h3>
        <p>The selection was presided over by me - <a href="https://twitter.com/vipulnsward">Vipul</a>,
          <a href="https://twitter.com/_cha1tanya">Prathamesh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/anildigital">Anil</a> </p>
        <br/><br />

        <h3 class="get-sponsors">Some Stats</h3>
        <p>As mentioned we had a total of 41 submissions. We got an overwhelming number of proposals for Speakers out of India, with 25 of these submissions being from a foreign presenter.
          16 of the proposals were from India.</p>
        <p>41 may seem a low number, but we had all top notch submissions from all around the world this year.
          <br/>
          The bar was really set high for selection.
          <br/>
          We accepted about initial 8 talks. 2 of the presenters could not make it, and hence we rolled on to the next 2 ones.
          <br/>
          In all we have 8 talks and 1 keynote.
        </p>
